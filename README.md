Our target audience are people who watch TV shows and would like to express their opinions about the show and see what other people thought about shows they watched. Our target audience would want to use our application because people like to see what other people think about something. Additionally people like to share opinions and the reviews would serve as an infomrative way for prospective viewers to see if they would be interested in the show.

As developers, we would like to build this application because this is an opportunity that we can apply our skills learned in this class to solve a real-world problem by implementing a platform that brings fans of TV shows together for an immense social expereince while enjoying their favoirte shows.
